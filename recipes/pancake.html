        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>These blueberry pancakes are the most fabulous pancakes I've ever eaten! My husband makes these and serves them with butter and brown sugar. Well worth the hour wait!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>All-purpose flour</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Baking powder</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Milk</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Frozen blueberries</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Combine milk and egg in a small bowl. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Stir in melted butter, then fold in blueberries. Set aside for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the hot griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles appear on the surface, then flip and cook until golden brown on both sides. Serve hot.</li>
